# Arduino Projects: Circuit Design & Robotics

Welcome to my personal collection of Arduino-based projects!  
This repository contains code for various circuit design experiments, robotics builds, and electronics projects that I’ve worked on — ranging from simple sensor tests to full robotic systems.

## Contents

- Circuit design projects (sensors, actuators, displays, etc.)
- Robotics projects (path-following robots, automation builds, control systems)
- Experimental setups and prototypes
- Code snippets and reusable modules

## How to Use

1. Browse the folders by project name.
2. Each project typically includes:
    - `.ino` files (Arduino code)
    - Circuit diagrams (where available)
    - Brief project notes or README
3. Open the `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE or compatible editor (such as PlatformIO).

## Hardware & Tools

- Arduino Nano / Uno / Mega (depending on project)
- Common sensors: IR, ultrasonic, LDR, moisture sensors, etc.
- Actuators: Motors, servos
- Displays: LCD, OLED
- Software: Arduino IDE, Tinkercad Circuits for simulation
